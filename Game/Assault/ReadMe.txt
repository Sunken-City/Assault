This milestone, I struggled a lot with morale. Because I had other
responsibilities going on this week, I was hard-pressed to find time to work
on this project. I had decided to work on it all weekend long, which normally
would have worked, but because of various life anxieties and having
the majority of the project ahead of me, I wasn't able to be as productive as
I would have liked to. I struggled in my code, and I wasn't able to write as
high of quality code as I would have liked. I'm beginning to realize that
despite my tendencies and desires to treat myself like a machine, I'm truly not.
I'm a human being, who needs to find a balance between work and play, and needs
to learn how to take a break and step away from his code every now and then to
gain a better perspective. I want to write code that I'm proud of, and I realize
now that I need to manage not only my time, but my morale as well. I plan to
adjust my schedule so that I can manage my morale without losing sight of my
goal; to become a better developer.
